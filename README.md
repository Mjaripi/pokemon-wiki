# Pok√©mon Wiki
A test connection project to the [Poke Api](https://pokeapi.co/), that we'll use due to the fact that this RESTful API is CORS available.

The project is based on a **react client** to handle the requests to the API, query the info and visualize the data.

To run the project it's needed to run the following command in a terminal located on the root folder of the project:
```bash
npm i && npm start
```
After this a front client should be running on localhost:3000 (a new window on your default browser should open itself).

Note: The API is able to give the full data of the pokedex, but for the purpose of this test, only the first 151 will be requested.
